Chapter 9: Characters and Strings: 
    * Challenges to flex your C++ muscles.
    * Note: 
      * Please carry out these challenges manually without using code generation tools like ChatGPT
      * Doing so will hurt your learning process and hinder your progress.

1. Character Analysis Tool

    Write a program in the main function that:

    * Asks the user to enter a line of text.
    * Counts and prints how many uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks the text contains.
    * Use functions from <cctype> like isupper(), islower(), isdigit(), and ispunct().
    * The program should repeatedly ask the user if they want to continue and give them the option to enter another line of text, until they choose to stop.

2. Manual String Copy

    Write a program that does the following:

    * Ask the user to enter a C-string.
    * Create another C-string of the same size.
    * Copy the content of the first string into the second one using <cstring> functions.
    * Print the copied string.
    * The program should repeatedly ask the user if they want to continue and give them the option to enter another string, until they choose to stop.

3. Word Reverser Program

    Write a program that does the following:

    * Ask the user to enter a sentence.
    * Reverse each word in the sentence but keep the order of the words.
    * Use std::string to manipulate the text.
    * The program should repeatedly ask the user if they want to continue and give them the option to enter another sentence, until they choose to stop.

4. Substring Search with std::string_view

    Write a program in main that:

    * Asks the user to enter a sentence and a word to search for.
    * Checks if the word exists in the sentence.
    * Prints whether the word was found or not.
    * Use std::string_view to search without copying data.
    * The program should repeatedly ask the user if they want to continue and give them the option to enter another sentence and word, until they choose to stop.

5. Simple Palindrome Checker

    In the main function:

    * Ask the user to enter a word or phrase.
    * Check if it is a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
    * Ignore case and punctuation when checking.
    * Print whether it is a palindrome or not.
    * Use facilities from <cstring>
    * The program should repeatedly ask the user if they want to continue and give them the option to enter another word or phrase, until they choose to stop.
